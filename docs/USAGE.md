# Usage

The NAnPack Learners edition is intended to be used for the purpose of teaching and learning various numerical schemes for model differential equations in engineering and science. Presently, the capability of the package is limited to solving fluid and heat transfer equations such as diffusion equation, Poisson's equation, wave equation, inviscid and viscous Burgers equation. 

### Objective
The primary objective of NAnPack-Learners package is to impart learning in numerical schemes and coding with a simplified approach to those who want to develop a necessary background in Computational Engineering and Sciences, especially, in Computational Fluid Dynamics. It is expected of users that they will use the libraries in this package and write their own codes or scripts to run simulations and analyse the output. The only pre-requisite is to have an interest and some experience in coding, physics and calculus.

An important motivation behind the development of this package is to equip early career CFD enthusiasts with the complete know-how of the subject. Therefore, our aim is to provide complete information regarding what is going on behind the scenes when you run a simulation starting from the very basic.

### Using NAnPack-Learners Package
Use NAnPack-Learners package to develop a fundamental background in computational methods in engineering. The package is designed in such a manner that the users are provided with the necessary tools and they are expected to build and execute their scripts using the package modules to perform numerical experimentations. Background on numerical schemes, physics, and built-in functions are presently provided in the tutorials section below. 

Users may follow the instructions and examples to learn to develop their codes and do investigations of their own. Users may also submit their examples through GitHub pull requests and contribute to the documentation. The developers of this package are looking forward to seeing your fun projects that you will do using NAnPack.
