# Credits

I would like to acknowledge that most modules of this package including the numerical methods, their description and the solved examples, are created using using the information in the book written by my PhD advisor Dr. Klaus A. Hoffmann [1] and using my notes from AE-719 Computational Fluid Dynamics, AE-919 Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics and AE-812 Viscous Fluid Flow courseworks at Wichita State University.
